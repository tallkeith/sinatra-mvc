# This is a numerology app. Just nter your birthdate and it will compute your number.
# The app first adds each digit of your birthdate together, so 08-06-1981 will be 0+8+0+6+1+9+8+1.
# If the result is greater than 9, the digits are added together again. The result is your numerology number.
# The app then gives you the message that is associated with your number.
# Thsi app was built using Sinatra.
